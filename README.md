# **Salary Insights: In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis and Payslip Generation**

This project dives into a **company's salary dataset for December 2016**, analyzing employee compensation structures and uncovering trends in salary distributions, gender representation, and designations. The dataset consists of key variables such as employee **names, gender, base salary, net salary, total deductions, and additions to salary**, which give a comprehensive view of how the final net salary is calculated.  

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, we explore various relationships, including **gender vs net salary** and **gender vs designation**, providing insights into how compensation differs across different roles and genders. Additionally, this project offers tools for **automated payslip generation**â€”both an **interactive payslip using Power BI** and a **printable payslip generated through Python in a Jupyter Notebook**.

## **Project Workflow**  

1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Addressed missing or inconsistent data
   - Removed duplicate records
   - Converted text columns like gender and designation into numerical values for analysis  
   - Ensured data consistency to facilitate seamless correlation analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Analyzed gender representation** across different designations  
   - **Compared net salary distribution by gender** to identify trends  
   - Used **column charts** to visualize gender vs designation  
   - Created **box plots** to compare base salaries across designations  

3. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Converted categorical variables into numeric representations  
   - Generated a **correlation matrix** to investigate relationships among base salary, net salary, and other variables  
   - Visualized correlations using **heatmaps** to identify significant patterns  

4. **Payslip Generation**  
   - **Power BI:** Designed an interactive payslip template within the dashboard  
   - **Python:** Automated **printable payslip generation** in Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to export and share  

5. **Workflow Automation with KNIME**  
   - Built an automated workflow to streamline data processing and ensure efficient analysis for future updates
